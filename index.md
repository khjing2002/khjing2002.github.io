Hi! I am Kaihao Jing, a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Shirshendu Ganguly](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~sganguly/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from University of Science and Technology of China, where my advisors were [Xinyi Li](http://faculty.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~xinyili/) and [Dangzheng Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q5EhbgoAAAAJ&hl=en). Here is my [CV](My_CV.pdf).

#### Research Interests

My current research interests lie in probability and its interaction with statistical physics.
